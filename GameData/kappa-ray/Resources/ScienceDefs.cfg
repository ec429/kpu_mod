	RESULTS
	{
		default = The instrument counts the kappa rays streaming through it.

		KerbinSrfLanded = It appears Kerbin's atmosphere protects the surface from all kappa radiation.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = It appears Kerbin's atmosphere protects the surface from all kappa radiation.
		KerbinFlyingLow = It appears kappa radiation does not penetrate this far into the atmosphere.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = A small number of stray kappa rays from the Van Allen belts reach the detector.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The main source of k-rads here seems to be the Van Allen belts.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Great belts of low-energy kappa radiation surround Kerbin.  Long-term exposure might cause some problems.

		SunInSpaceLow = The corona is a very harsh environment.  Being surrounded by energetic plasma does tend to lead to a high level of radiation.
		SunInSpaceHigh = There's a lot of radiation flying around here.  How good is our shielding?

		Mun = The Mun has no magnetosphere of its own, but Kerbin's field gives some protection from cosmic rays.

		MohoSrfLanded = The rotation of Moho's large, iron-rich core is generating a decent magnetic field.  The proximity to the Sun has pumped up Moho's Van Allen belts, partially making up for the low field strength.
		MohoInSpaceLow = The rotation of Moho's large, iron-rich core is generating a decent magnetic field.  The proximity to the Sun has pumped up Moho's Van Allen belts, partially making up for the low field strength.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho's magnetic field is insufficient to block cosmic rays at this range, and the solar wind is intense here.
		EveSrfLanded = It appears Eve's thick atmosphere blocks all kappa radiation from reaching the surface.
		EveSrfSplashed = It appears Eve's thick atmosphere blocks all kappa radiation from reaching the surface.
		EveFlyingLow = No kappa rays here.
		EveFlyingHigh = The occasional low-energy kappa ray hints of strong belts above.
		EveInSpaceLow = The instrument is clicking madly and trying to jump out of its box.  Eve's radiation belts must be very strong!
		EveInSpaceHigh = Cosmic rays won't get anywhere near Eve.  Perhaps they're scared of it?
		DunaSrfLanded = Kappa rays can't quite penetrate the dusty red atmosphere.
		DunaFlying = There aren't many clicks to be heard from the Keiger counter.
		DunaInSpace = The geologically dead planet has little magnetism, leaving nearby space unprotected from kappa radiation.
		Jool = The vicinity of Jool is a high-radiation environment.
		JoolFlyingLow = The gases seem to block the radiation OK.
		JoolSrfLanded = Well, at least radiation is one thing that isn't trying to kill us here.  The atmosphere blocks it all.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Laythe's atmosphere helpfully absorbs all incoming kappa rays, keeping the surface safe.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Laythe's atmosphere helpfully absorbs all incoming kappa rays, keeping the surface safe.
		LaytheInSpace = Laythe is subjected to a considerable magnetic beating from Jool which produces some radiation belts.  However Jool does also help to block out other radiation.
		Bop = It seems the rocks of Bop are radioactive!
		Dres = Nothing happens.
		DresSrfLanded = Twice as much happens.
		Eeloo = Currents of dissolved ions in Eeloo's icy mantle produce a magnetic field, reducing cosmic ray flux.
		EelooInSpaceLow = Yes, Eeloo does have Van Allen belts.  They're rather feeble though.
