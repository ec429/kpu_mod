Known bugs:

Vessels other than the active one don't currently get radiation fired at them.
This is because turning that on causes the following bugs:
{
	Vessels out of physics range appear to fire their radiation at the active
	 vessel (their CoM is nonsense / in the wrong co-ordinate system).  This
	 is especially problematic because of asteroids, which are almost always
	 bathed in solar and galactic radiation.

	If there are multiple vessels in close proximity, each might get some of
	 the other's radiation.  Close proximity means about 10km.
	However, it's only _likely_ to take hits if it's much closer, as all
	 radiation is aimed within a 10m sphere of the CoM.
	This shouldn't be a problem, as vessels this close should have similar
	 radiation environments.  Also, the radiation isn't duplicated; if the
	 'wrong' vessel absorbs it, it won't then go on to hit the 'right' one.
	 So one vessel can shield another.
}

Under some circumstances extra radiation readouts appear in the screen
 messages.  I don't know why (but those screen messages are only an interim
 anyway, pending a proper UI).
