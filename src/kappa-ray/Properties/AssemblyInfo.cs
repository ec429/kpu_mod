// The form "{Major}.{Minor}.*" will automatically update the build and revision,
// and "{Major}.{Minor}.{Build}.*" will update just the revision.

// Don't include the patch revision in the AssemblyVersion - as this will break any dependent
// DLLs any time it changes.  Breaking on a minor revision is probably acceptable - it's
// unlikely that there wouldn't be other breaking changes on a minor version change.
