Three types of radiation source:
van-allen: ambient, low-energy
solar: directed, medium-energy, inverse-square intensity
galactic: ambient, high-energy, low-rate

van-allen and solar vary with solar activity and (directional) solar storms

On terrestrial planets with magnetosphere and atmosphere, get earthlike behaviour:
(altitudes given for Kerbin, in m)
situation	altitude	van-allen	solar		galactic
sea level	      0		negligible	negligible	negligible
aircraft	  10000		very low	negligible	negligible
upper atmos	  40000		low		very low	negligible
low orbit	  70000		moderate	very low	negligible
		 250000		high		very low	negligible
mid orbit	 600000		very high	low		negligible
		1200000		moderate	moderate	very low
high orbit	2500000		negligible	moderate	low

interplanetary space		none		high		moderate

Effects of radiation strikes:

On shielding, some is absorbed, and gives off heat proportional to energy.
On command pods, has a (very small) chance to harm Kerbals:
	low energy: may cause cancer (Kerbal dies several years later).
	high energy: may cause immediate radiation sickness, imminent death of Kerbal.
On solar panels, degrades cells, reducing power output.
On KPUs, may cause SEUs (e.g. latch changes?  program halts?) or noisy sensor readings.
