PART CATEGORIES
KPU, performs processing of the stored instructions.  Later models gain a wider instruction set and more IMEM
Planetary IR sensor, determines distance & direction of body being orbited.  [Uses solid angle & known size to determine distance, fails if too close to sun]
Stellar compass, helps determine orientation.  Variants:
	Type I: can only follow a single star (so has a rotational degree of freedom)
	Type II: "Canopus tracker", gives full orientation with an inertial platform (otherwise Type I)
	Type III: wide-field stellar compass, full autonomous orientation
Radioaltimeter, determines altitude.  Later models gain Doppler for surface velocity
Inertial platform, gives acceleration, computes velocity & position based on a previous 'fix', also gives orientation.  (A 'fix' requires full orientation.)  Results will drift over time leading to degraded accuracy if fixes are infrequent
KNS, supplies navigational data close to Kerbin by use of ground signals and/or satellite "GPS".  Later models improve precision and range
Stock landing gear, incorporates sensors to determine touchdown
Stock sensors.  Some of the science experiments in stock are also usable sensors:
	Gravioli detector.  Gives localGravity (handy for landing)
	PresMat Barometer.  Gives airPressure (no idea what use this would be)
	2HOT Thermometer.  Gives temperature (maybe useful to deal with overheating?)

MANUFACTURERS
Kelliot Automation: The world leaders in industrial process automation, Kelliot consider even Rockomax engines to be "quaint, tiny machines".
Kerbolics: A start-up company formed by some bearded researchers from the Kerbal Institute of Technology to manufacture intelligence.
Kerbal Instruments: Rumours that KI's semiconductors are made by children with tweezers have been firmly denied by the Board.
Kybernetics Inc.: A semiconductor fab founded by disgruntled ex-KI employees.
Probodobodyne: Of *course* they have a computer division.

PARTS (* = implemented with placeholder model, + = also has model)
*Kelliot 4040 KPU.  This simple processor can be instructed to take actions on edge-triggered conditions of a single variable.
*Kelliot 8080 KPU.  Improvements in Kelliot's automation technology enabled the 8080, which can AND or OR multiple conditions, and supports time-delays
*Kelliot KE-7 KPU.  The incorporation of arithmetic and level-triggered actions allows a whole new kind of programming.
Kerbolics LITHP-M.  This hardware implementation of John McKerthy's LITHP system gives power equal to the KE-7 without the weight or the huge current draw.
*Kerbolics Mk1 Eyeball.  A planetary IR sensor that only functions on the light side of the planet or in darkness.
*KI "Spot" PIR.  Copes with sun angles down to 30°.
*PB "Vega" ST-1.  A Type I star tracker with 2° accuracy.
*PB "Sirius" ST-5.  After several failed attempts, Probodobodyne finally improved on the Vega with this 30' Type I star tracker.
*Kybernetics CSC.  This revolutionary "Type II" multiple-sensor star tracker enables Mission Control to reliably determine probe orientation to within 15'.
Kybernetics "Pollux" CSA.  The on-board processing of this Type III stellar compass is capable of calculating orientation with sub-arcminute accuracy.
*KI RA-3 "Ping".  This basic radioaltimeter gives height over ground to about 50m accuracy.
*PB FS-RA.  By measuring the Koppler shift, this radioaltimeter can also determine ground speed and (if orientation is known) course.
*Kerbolics "Tympanum" Inertial Platform.  If you knew where you were, now you can know where you are!  (Only partially implemented.)
*Kybernetics KNS.  The "Kerbal Navigation System" will give you a full position and velocity report from anywhere within 300km of Kerbin.
*KI "LORAN".  The LOng RAnge Navigation system from Kerbal Instruments gives KNS-like functionality out to a 3Mm range!
